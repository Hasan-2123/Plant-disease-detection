    #### About Dataset
    This dataset is recreated using offline augmentation from the original dataset. The original dataset can be found on this github repo. This dataset consists of about 87K rgb images of healthy and diseased crop leaves which is categorized into 38 different classes. The total dataset is divided into 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure. A new directory containing 33 test images is created later for prediction purpose.
    #### Content
    1. Train (70295 images)
    2. Valid (17572 image)
    3. Test (33 images)
    #### About Our Team
    We are a passionate team of five tech enthusiasts who came together with a shared goal: to harness the power of deep learning to support agriculture. Our project, Plant Disease Detection Using Deep Learning Algorithms, aims to help farmers and agricultural experts detect plant diseases early through an intelligent, image-based detection system.

    Meet the Team:
                
    [**Ali Ammar Hasan**] ‚Äì **Team Leader & Deep Learning Engineer**
                
    Oversaw the project from start to finish and Built and fine-tuned the deep learning model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for accurate detection of plant diseases from leaf images.

    [**Almas Raza**] ‚Äì **Dataset Manager & Preprocessing Expert**
                
    Collected and cleaned the image dataset, performed data augmentation, and ensured high-quality input for training the model.

    [**Disha Rathod**] ‚Äì **Research & Documentation Lead**
                
    Focused on researching plant diseases, symptoms, and agricultural impacts, and prepared clear documentation and project reports.

    [**Ahmed Kaif**] ‚Äì **UI/UX Designer & Presentation Specialist**
                
    Designed the interface for an intuitive user experience and contributed to the visual elements and final project presentation.

    [**Syed Zaheer Ul Haque**] ‚Äì **Web Developer**
                
    developed the web application to make the detection tool accessible and user-friendly.

    Our teamwork reflects a blend of creativity, technology, and purpose. With this project, we hope to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and sustainable agriculture.
                
    #### About Project 
    
    Agriculture plays a vital role in sustaining economies and ensuring food security worldwide. One of the major challenges faced by farmers is the early and accurate detection of plant diseases, which can severely affect crop quality and yield. Traditional methods of disease identification are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often require expert knowledge.

    This project, "Plant Disease Detection Using Deep Learning Algorithms," presents an intelligent solution to this problem by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and computer vision. We developed a deep learning-based model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically identify plant diseases from leaf images. The system was trained on a diverse dataset of diseased and healthy plant leaves, achieving high accuracy in classification.

    The final solution is integrated into a user-friendly web application that allows users to upload images of plant leaves and receive instant feedback about possible diseases, along with suggested preventive measures. This tool is designed to assist farmers, agricultural workers, and researchers in making timely decisions to reduce crop losses and enhance productivity.

    By combining deep learning with accessible technology, our project offers a scalable and cost-effective approach to disease detection in agriculture, contributing to more sustainable and informed farming practices.
