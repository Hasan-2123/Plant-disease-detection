# Plant-disease-detection using Deep Learning Algorithm

This project uses deep learning techniques to automatically detect and classify plant diseases from leaf images. It is aimed at helping farmers and agricultural experts quickly identify plant issues and take timely action to prevent crop loss.
🌱 Overview
Early detection of plant diseases is crucial for maintaining crop health and productivity. This project applies convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to image data of plant leaves to classify whether they are healthy or infected, and if infected, identify the specific disease.

🚀 Features
Image classification using deep learning (CNN)

Trained on publicly available plant disease datasets

High accuracy and fast inference

Easily extendable to other plant species or diseases

Jupyter Notebook and Python-based implementation

📂 Dataset
We used the kaggle, which contains 87,000 labeled images of healthy and diseased plant leaves across various species.

Source: Kaggle

Classes: Multiple diseases across crops like Tomato, Potato, Corn, etc.

🧠 Model Architecture
Model Type: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Framework: TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch if applicable)

Input Size: 224x224 RGB images

Layers: Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout, Dense

Activation: ReLU and Softmax

Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy

Optimizer: Adam
